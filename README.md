# paddle_game
This is a basic 2-D paddle game similar to the classic arcade game Araknoid. I will change out the paddle for one of my original drawings, a crazy grandma, and the ball for a fish. I may change the layout to look more like a haunted house so that the blocks then become furniture or something like that. I also may add vertical movement for the grandma and take away the feature where you lose if the ball goes off the lower portion of the screen, this way the grandma can venture forward and get things which will then move you to new levels or get you points.
